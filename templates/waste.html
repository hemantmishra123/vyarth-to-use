                                Waste is a product or substance which is no longer suited for its intended use. Whereas in natural ecosystems waste (i.e. oxygen, carbon dioxide and dead organic matter) is used as food or a reactant, waste materials resulting from human activities are often highly resilient and take a long time to decompose.

                           <p>
                             For legislators and governments, defining and classifying waste based on risks related to the environment and human health are therefore important in order to provide appropriate and effective waste management. For the producer or holder, assessing whether a material is waste or not is important in identifying whether waste rules should be followed. Definitions are also relevant in the collection and analysis of waste data as well as in domestic and international reporting obligations.

                                    <p>Hazardous waste is waste that has been identified as potentially causing harm to the environment and human health and therefore needs special, separate treatment and handling . Chemical and physical characteristics determine the exact collection and recycling process.Chemical treatment, incineration or high-temperature treatment, safe storage, recovery and recycling are possible modes of treatment for hazardous waste. Most hazardous waste originates from industrial production. Special kinds of hazardous waste include:</p>

The negative effects of improper waste management not only ends in a disgusting view but also affects the overall economy of a country. The state has to spend a lot of money to counter the effects of improper waste management. Moreover, animals depended on the environment also face a great threat due to the oil spills and leaching of chemicals which directly cause soil and water contamination. Burning of any disposed waste and plastic materials results in air and environmental pollution.
