							Biodegradable waste includes any organic matter in waste which can be broken down into carbon dioxide, water, methane or simple organic molecules by micro-organisms and other living things by composting, aerobic digestion, anaerobic digestion or similar processes. In waste management, it also includes some inorganic materials which can be decomposed by bacteria. Such materials include gypsum and its products such as plasterboard and other simple sulfates which can be decomposed by sulfate reducing bacteria to yield hydrogen sulfide in anaerobic land-fill conditions.
							
							</p>

                           <p>

                           Biodegradable waste when not handled properly can have an outsized impact on climate change, especially through methane emissions from anaerobic fermentation that produces landfill gas. Other approaches to reducing the impact include reducing the amount of waste produced, such as through reducing food waste. This type of waste is easily degraded by microbes

                                     <p>
									 Biodegradable waste is a type of waste, typically originating from plant or animal sources, which may be degraded by other living organisms. Wastes that cannot be broken by other living organisms are called non-biodegradable. Biodegradable waste can be commonly found in municipal solid waste (sometimes called biodegradable municipal waste, or BMW) as green waste, food waste, paper waste and biodegradable plastic.

The negative effects of improper waste management not only ends in a disgusting view but also affects the overall economy of a country. The state has to spend a lot of money to counter the effects of improper waste management. Moreover, animals depended on the environment also face a great threat due to the oil spills and leaching of chemicals which directly cause soil and water contamination. Burning of any disposed waste and plastic materials results in air and environmental pollution.
